El Calafate, also known as Calafate, is a city in Patagonia, Argentina. It is situated on the southern border of Lake Argentino, in the southwest part of the Santa Cruz Province, about 320 kilometres (200 mi) northwest of Río Gallegos. The name of the city is derived from a little bush with yellow flowers and dark blue berries that is very common in Patagonia: the calafate (Berberis buxifolia); the word comes from the word calafate, which is Spanish for 'caulk'.

Glaciarium (museum)


The centre is dedicated to ice and glaciers, and is designed to educate visitors about these natural phenomena in depth. The scientific director is glaciologist Pedro Skvarca. The building is formed by a main hall and three exhibitions halls, a total of 2,500 square metres (27,000 sq ft). Two halls house the permanent glaciological exhibits that include dioramas, multimedia, 3D models, and other modern resources. The third hall is a cultural venue and movie theatre where 3D documentaries and other films are screened.

Magellanic penguin, (Spheniscus magellanicus), species of penguin (order Sphenisciformes) characterized by the presence of a broad crescent of white feathers that extends from just above each eye to the chin, a horseshoe-shaped band of black feathers that cuts across the white feathers on the chest and abdomen, and a small but noticeable region of pink flesh on the face. Adults are sometimes mistaken for African penguins (Spheniscus demersus), which display a small fleshy region over each eye, or Humboldt penguins (S. humboldti), whose fleshy region encompasses the base of the beak and both eyes. The geographic range of the Magellanic penguin is limited to the Falkland Islands and several nearshore islands along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of southern South America; however, some individuals have traveled as far as Peru, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and the Antarctic Peninsula. Magellanic penguins are named for Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan; however, Italian explorer Antonio Pigafetta, who traveled with Magellan during his attempt to circumnavigate the globe in 1520, is credited with sighting the species.

Monte Fitz Roy
The first Europeans recorded as seeing Mount Fitz Roy were the Spanish explorer Antonio de Viedma and his companions, who reached the shores of Viedma Lake in 1783. Argentine explorer Francisco Moreno saw the mountain on 2 March 1877; he named it Fitz Roy in honour of Robert FitzRoy who, as captain of HMS Beagle, had travelled up the Santa Cruz River in 1834 and charted large parts of the Patagonian coast.[7]

It is located on the riverside of Rio de las Vueltas, within the Los Glaciares National Park (section Reserva Nacional Zona Viedma) near the base of Cerro Torre and Cerro Fitz Roy spires, both popular for climbing. It is 220 km north of El Calafate. It is also a popular base for hiking numerous trails, such as those to the base of surrounding peaks and glacial lakes, such as Laguna Torre and Laguna de los Tres (near the base of Fitz Roy).[1][2][3]
